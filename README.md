# Mastermind Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic Mastermind game, adapted from a guided learning exercise. I've made several modifications to enhance the user experience and improve the code's clarity.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/Ra-Verse/Mastermind_Terminal`
2. **Run the game:** 
3. **Guess the code:** The code consists of 4 colors, chosen from: R, B, Y, O, G, W.
4. **Feedback:** After each guess, you'll receive feedback:
   - Correct positions: Number of colors in the correct spot.
   - Incorrect positions: Number of correct colors in the wrong spot.
5. **Win or Lose:** You have 10 attempts to crack the code. If you guess correctly within the attempts, you win! Otherwise, you lose.

## Modifications

This project started as a guided tutorial. I've implemented the following changes:

* **Enhanced input validation:** Ensures only valid colors and the correct number of guesses are accepted.
* **Improved feedback:** Provides clearer feedback to the player, indicating correct and incorrect positions.
* **Code refactoring:** Improved code structure for better readability and maintainability.

## Skills Demonstrated

* Python fundamentals (variables, lists, loops, conditionals)
* Game logic implementation
* Input validation
* Code refactoring
